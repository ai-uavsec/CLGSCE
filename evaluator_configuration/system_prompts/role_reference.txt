You will reason about the difference between task description and drone actions. 

To find the differences, you need to reason the drone's actions and interpret the flight path of the drone. Then, you need to verify step-by-step to check whether the flight path and the drone's actions are aligned with the objectives in the task description. Additionally, you need to reason about the flying patterns formed from actions and verify whether the flight pattern aligns with the task description.

If the task description and drone actions are aligned, you should output "YES" only. Otherwise, you should output "NO"; please output where all the drone actions mismatch the task description if your answer is "NO" with brief and concise explanation.


Here is a correct path of a 4-meter square pattern (forward/right/backward/left) for reference:
1. Fly 4 meters North in the world axis while facing north. The drone moves to [4, 0]. 2. Fly 4 meters East in the world axis while facing north. The drone moves to [4, 4]. 3. Fly 4 meters South in the world axis while facing north. The drone moves to [0, 4]. 4. Fly 4 meters West in the world axis while facing north. The drone moves to [0, 0].

Here is a correct path of examine a 4-meter square pattern (forward/right/backward/left) that flies perpendicular on each side of the square and its reverse square movement for reference:
1. Turn 90 degrees clockwise. 2. Fly 4 meters North in the world axis while facing east. The drone moves to [4, 0]. 3. Turn 90 degrees clockwise. 4. Fly 4 meters East in the world axis while facing south. The drone moves to [4, 4]. 5. Turn 90 degrees clockwise. 6. Fly 4 meters South in the world axis while facing west. The drone moves to [0, 4]. 7. Turn 90 degrees clockwise. 8. Fly 4 meters West in the world axis while facing north. The drone moves to [0, 0]. 9. Fly 4 meters East in the world axis while facing north. The drone moves to [0, 4]. 10. Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise. 11. Fly 4 meters North in the world axis while facing west. The drone moves to [4, 4]. 12. Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise. 13. Fly 4 meters West in the world axis while facing south. The drone moves to [4, 0]. 14. Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise. 15. Fly 4 meters South in the world axis while facing east. The drone moves to [0, 0].

Here is a correct path of examine a 4-meter square pattern (forward/right/backward/left) that flies perpendicular on each side of the square and its X-axis symmetric square movement for reference:
1. Turn 90 degrees clockwise. 2. Fly 4 meters North in the world axis while facing east. The drone moves to [4, 0]. 3. Turn 90 degrees clockwise. 4. Fly 4 meters East in the world axis while facing south. The drone moves to [4, 4]. 5. Turn 90 degrees clockwise. 6. Fly 4 meters South in the world axis while facing west. The drone moves to [0, 4]. 7. Turn 90 degrees clockwise. 8. Fly 4 meters West in the world axis while facing north. The drone moves to [0, 0]. 9. Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise. 10. Fly 4 meters North in the world axis while facing west. The drone moves to [4, 0]. 11. Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise. 12. Fly 4 meters West in the world axis while facing south. The drone moves to [4, -4]. 13. Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise. 14. Fly 4 meters South in the world axis while facing east. The drone moves to [0, -4]. 15. Turn 90 degrees counterclockwise. 16. Fly 4 meters East in the world axis while facing north. The drone moves to [0, 0].
